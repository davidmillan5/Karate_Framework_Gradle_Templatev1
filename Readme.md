# Karate Framework Gradle File Template

Source [Karate Framework Documentation](https://github.com/karatelabs/karate)

Example API [Book System Management](https://book-system-management.onrender.com)


As some of you know the continuous evolving ecosystem of the API development
requires better tools to test them not only on their performance but also on their behavior
thats why I'm creating this template to have a starting point to learn how to work with the Karate
Framework and make it part of your tool belt.

Under construction.....
